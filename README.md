# FS-code: A Simple Python IDE

FS-code is a basic Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) built using Tkinter. It provides a simple interface for writing, executing, and viewing the output of Python code.

## Features

*   **Code Editor:** A text area for writing Python code.
*   **Output Area:** Displays the output or error messages from code execution.
*   **Run Button:** Executes the code in the editor.
*   **Clear Button:** Clears the output area.
*   **File Menu:** Currently includes placeholders for Open, Save, and Exit functionalities.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x
    *   Tkinter (usually included with Python)

2.  **Installation:**
    *   No installation needed. Just make sure you have the prerequisites.

3.  **Running the IDE:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved the `app.py` file.
    *   Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Write your Python code** in the code editor.
2.  **Click the "Run" button** to execute the code.
3.  **View the output** (or any error messages) in the output area.
4.  **Use the "Clear" button** to reset the output area.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement file operations (Open, Save).
*   Add syntax highlighting to the code editor.
*   Include more advanced features like debugging, code completion, etc.
*   Package the application for distribution on different platforms.
